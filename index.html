                <h2>Programs and Activities</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Founded in 1990 by a group of engaged community members, LYG has served over 5,000 youth and young adults, age 14 to 21, in its history.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Today, more than 200 LGBTQIA+ and Allied young people each year participate in programs that provide social support, positive role models and health education.
                </p>
                
                <div class="weekly-meetings">
                    <h4>Weekly Meetings</h4>

                    <p>
                        Fridays, 7:30p to 10:30p
                        Each week, LYG brings together LGBTQIA+ youth in a safe, fun and social setting. Themes and topics include: game night, suicide prevention, dance parties, and health education (just to name a few!)                
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Trans/Ally Night – 2nd and 4th Wednesday from 6:00p to 9:00p
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Other programs include:</h3>
                
                <h4>Youth Leadership Council</h4>
                <p>
                    The YLC is an opportunity for youth to gain vital leadership skills and help determine the activities of LYG. Council members lead sessions, plan events, and advise the LYG Board of Directors.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Leadership Camp</h4>
                
                <p>
                    Always a youth favorite, LYG Camp is a fun weekend to socialize, learn leadership skills, and get out in nature. Activities include campfires, night hikes, challenge course, lots of eating, and lively conversation.
                </p>
                <h4>GSTA Outreach</h4>
                <p>
                    Youth and educators learn how to start and grow a Gay-Straight-Trans Alliance. Participants also learn a student’s legal right to a safe learning environment.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Prom</h4>
                <p>
                    Many LGBTQIA+ youth feel unsafe taking their date to Prom. LYG’s Prom is a fun and safe experience for ALL youth, regardless of sexuality or gender identity.
                </p>

                <h1>Mentors</h1>
                <p>
                    Volunteer Mentors are a vital part of Louisville Youth Group. In all activities with youth, mentors are needed to:
                </p>
                <h3>Maintain a safe space for youth</h3>
                <p>
                    We work very hard to ensure LYG is a space free of harassment, discrimination, intimidation or bullying at all times.
                </p>
                <h3>Build trust through confidentiality</h3>
                <p>
                    Mentors build trust and a sense of safety within Louisville Youth Group by keeping all personal information within the group.
                </p>
                <h3>Mentor first</h3>
                <p>
                    While many mentors have professional training as therapists or educators, when at LYG, their role is to be a trustworthy adult guide.
                </p>
                <h3>Lift up our youth</h3>
                <p>
                    Put downs, harsh destructive criticism and biting sarcasm run the risk of belittling people. While at LYG, we ask that mentors communicate from an asset based and “put-up” framework. Accentuating the positives in our participants will help build their sense of self and create a place of mutual respect.
                </p>
                <h3>Promote positive discussion</h3>
                <p>
                    Mentors encourage intentional, meaningful, and respectful dialogue. They help shift conversations that help young people seek to understand before seeking to be understood.
                </p>
                <h3>Keep an eye out for needs</h3>
                <p>
                    Within our safe and trusting environment, young people sometimes share information on serious personal or family problems. Mentors are trained to look for and respond appropriately to urgent and ongoing needs of youth.
                </p>
