[Louisville Youth Group] is a website for a local non-profit that is dedicated to helping and supporting young people by providing resources and a safe social atmosphere regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. 

This site uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap framework.  HTML is used for the structural content and CSS was used for the site specific styling.  I chose to use the Bootstrap framework to help make the site reflexive (although I did include some styling in a breakpoint to help fix any issues).  JavaScript is used to add an email subscription reminder alert to the website when it is visied for the first time, and a thank you message if the user does subscribe to the email list.

Site was created by Kami Jenkins with the content provided by and created with the cooperation of Louisville Youth Group, a wonderful non-profit youth organization.
