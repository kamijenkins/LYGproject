# [Louisville Youth Group] is a website for a local non-profit that is dedicated to helping and supporting young people by providing resources and a safe social atmosphere regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. JavaScript was used to create the alert box that pops up when you open the site reminding you to subscribe to the E-Newsletter, as well as the confirmation alert box when you submit your email address. I used Bootstrap to create the modal window and Jumbotron, and some custom HTML and CSS for other styling. There is also a Facebook social media button in the footer that is linked to the LYG Facebook page.
